 A promise represents the future value of a task.

 To obtain the value of a promise we call `then`.

 Promises are chainable: `then` returns a promise, you can call `then` on
 that promise, which  returns a promise, you can call `then` on that
 promise, et cetera.

 Promises start in a pending state and *resolve* with a value to become
 *fulfilled* or with an `NSError` to become rejected.

 is resolved. This means you cannot predict the queue.

 In the case that the promise is already resolved the handler will be
 executed immediately.

 application code in situations where performance is critical, but be

 Waldo is dangerous.

 Waldo is zalgo, unless the current queue is the main thread, in which case
 we dispatch to the default background queue.

 If your block is likely to take more than a few milliseconds to execute,
 then you should use waldo: 60fps means the main thread cannot hang longer
 than 17 milliseconds. Don’t contribute to UI lag.

 Conversely if your then block is trivial, use zalgo: GCD is not free and
 for whatever reason you may already be on the main thread so just do what
 you are doing quickly and pass on execution.

 It is considered good practice for asynchronous APIs to complete onto the
 main thread. Apple do not always honor this, nor do other developers.
 However, they *should*. In that respect waldo is a good choice if your
 then is going to take a while and doesn’t interact with the UI.

 Please note (again) that generally you should not use zalgo or waldo. The
 performance gains are neglible and we provide these functions only out of
 a misguided sense that library code should be as optimized as possible.
 If you use zalgo or waldo without tests proving their correctness you may
 unwillingly introduce horrendous, near-impossible-to-trace bugs.
